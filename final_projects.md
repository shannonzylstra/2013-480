# Final Projects

 - **Billera-Lee Polytopes** (Jose Samper): Construct Billera-Lee polytopes (for Ph.D. research) using combination of Sage and polymake... but Sage has a lot hidden for this.  <https://github.com/samper/final-project-sage>

 - **Baseball statistics and coordinate descent LASSO** (Tyler Oshiro): My project is a coordinate descent LASSO algorithm used to test linear models within baseball statistics. <https://github.com/oshiroty/project>

 - **Matrix Interact** (Henry Riely) : <https://github.com/hriely/MATH480-FINAL>


 - **Tic-Tac-Toe** (Jasper Mishra): AI engine for 2-player game. Implement n x m tic-tac-toe *and* obstacles.  Find the best move. <https://github.com/jbloom1704/finalproj>

 - **Income prediction using decision trees** (Jason Uanon, Ayla Lampard):  <https://github.com/uanonj/uw-math480-final>

 - **Convergence of Infinite Series** (Chol Yoon): Exploring various series convergence theorems such as the Root Test and the Ratio Test computationally <https://github.com/susuk4/Final_Project>

 - **Black-Scholes** (Brian Manion): <https://github.com/Globey/M480-Final-Black-Scholes-Options-Pricing>

 - **The Golden Ratio** (Trevor Lewis): exploring the Golden ratio. -- <https://github.com/lewis103/Math480-FinalProject>


## Monday, June 3

 - **Polygons** (Mary & Rebecca): 2d polygon class, intersections, areas, etc.; done currently by the Sage Polyhedral class.  Improve documentation.

 - **The Simplex Algorithm** (Andrea & Brian & Mellisa, Gary): Simplex algorithm for optimization.   (cvxopt package; always give inputs like float(2.3) rather than 2.3; or put percent "python";  simplex algorithm, min/max; TUTORIAL. Graphically visualize each ste; Optimization.  Making some functionality of cvxopt more user friendly...

 - **Thin SVD** (Taylor & James): thin SVD (remove some columns); something new



## Wednesday, June 5

 - **Markov Process** (Mark): raw data; updating transitional matrix.  markov process.  (see stats.hmm)

 - **Music generation using Markov Models** (Kevin Clark)

- **Real World Graphs** (Clara): Sage graphs using "real world" data.

 - **Statistics Data** (Tian Yu): Sage/Python <---> statistics data.  Given a bunch of data, you give feedback. Consider <http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net/> which is in cloud.sagemath.

 - **Game of GO AI** (Sean & Alex & Daae): game of GO AI;   human versus computer.


 - **Statistics in Sage** (Shannon Zylstra)

 ## Friday, June 7



 - **Musical Tempered Scale** (Kippy):  make your own musical scale.



 - **Problem** (Hon, Hao, Wu, Qian) --pos integer in binary; put + digits in compute sum, get another binary number.  Is there a number  c so that any number goes to 1 in at most c steps.

 - **Computing Fermat points** (Hon, Hao, Wu, Qian) -- m points in R^d; find one point so that the sum of the distance to the m points is minimized. Three algorithms to solve... which is best.  Use cvxopt to implement one of them.

 - **Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman** (Josh): implement elliptic curve cryptosystem... Diffie-Hellman.  Koblitz book on this.

 - **Groebner Bases** (Abraham Engle)



## Not presenting

I'm not going to force anybody to give a presentation.
If you don't feel like presenting for any personal reason, that's OK, and will not negatively impact your grade.


 - **Volumes and Areas** (Lucy Wy)

 - **Generate Music using HMM's** (Kevin Clark) A program that procedurally generates music. I plan to do this by using Markov Models trained on a database of music notations.

 - **Improve logic.py** (Dwight & Tannor & Jessica): the logic.py file (beginner sage tickets).


 - **Improve logic.py** (Dwight & Tannor & Jessica): the logic.py file (beginner sage tickets).
