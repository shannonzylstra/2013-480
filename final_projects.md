# Final Projects

 - **Billera-Lee Polytopes** (Jose Samper): Construct Billera-Lee polytopes (for Ph.D. research) using combination of Sage and polymake... but Sage has a lot hidden for this.  <https://github.com/samper/final-project-sage>

 - **Finding the Best Location for Business** (Tianyu Yang): <https://github.com/TianyuYang/final_project>

 - **Challenge Problem** (Hon, Hao, Wu, Qian) --pos integer in binary; put + digits in compute sum, get another binary number.  Is there a number  c so that any number goes to 1 in at most c steps.
<https://github.com/honleungdydx/Math480-Project/tree/master/Challenge%20Problem>

 - **Computing Fermat points** (Hon, Hao, Wu, Qian) -- m points in R^d; find one point so that the sum of the distance to the m points is minimized. Three algorithms to solve... which is best.
Use cvxopt to implement them. <https://github.com/honleungdydx/Math480-Project/tree/master/Fermat-Point-Problem>
