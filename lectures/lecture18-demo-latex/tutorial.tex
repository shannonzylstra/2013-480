\section{Introduction}

This is an amazing paper about something.  We explain our notation in Section \ref{notation}.

\subsection{Background}
This was really hard.  It started back in the ninety hundred and ninetees...  The difficulties were:

\begin{itemize}   % {enumerate} for numbers
   \item It was tricky.

   \item I was distracted.
\end{itemize}

\begin{quote}
``Life is good.''
\end{quote}



\begin{enumerate}   % {enumerate} for numbers
   \item It was tricky.

   \item I was distracted.
\end{enumerate}

Our main result:

\begin{theorem}[Me]
There is a set.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Notation}\label{notation}

We consider $n=pq$.

We also consider Diffie-Hellman on an elliptic curve
$$
   y^2 = x^3 + Ax + b.
